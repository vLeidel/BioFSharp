# PDBParser

<i>Summary</i>: This part of the documentation provides an detailed overview 
of how to parse different levels as well as the complete PDB files using 
BioFSharp. 

<h2>Abstract:</h2>

Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format is the standard format for representing 
three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules, such as proteins and
nucleic acids, along with additional metadata information. The PDB format is 
commonly stored in text files with the extension `.pdb. and serve as a foundation 
for computational biology and structural bioinformatics applications. <br>

For that reason we implement a parser for the PDB file format in BioFSharp,
using the approach of Haskell by M.j.Gajda (hPDB) as template 
(<i>Gaja, 2010</i>; <i>Gaja, 2013</i>), that read the PDB file format and structure the data in the types metadata, atom,
residue, chain, model and complete structure (Fig.1). <br>

# 1. Theoretical Background

### 1.1. Protein structure modelling 

<p>
A protein is a functional and structural important part in Living cells. 
In general it is a Bio macromolecule from amino acid residues covalently linked 
together by peptide bonds. The structure of proteins is organized in four 
hierarchical levels

<ul>
   <li> <b> primary structure </b>: Sequence of covalently linked amino acid 
   residues </li>
   <li> <b>secoundary structure </b>: Local conformation of a polypeptide chain,
   typically &#945; helices or &#946; strands </li>
   <li ><b> tertiary structure </b>: 3D structure of a protein, describing the 
   average relative position of all atoms present, including bond lengths and 
   bond angles </li>
    <li> <b> Quaternary structure </b>: Spatial structure of a protein complex
    consisting of more than one polypeptide chain </li>
</ul>

The structure of a protein is especially important for the functionality of a 
protein because it defines possible protein-protein interactions and play additional 
a role in protein folding. For that reasons the protein structure information’s, 
often identified experimentally e.g. by X ray microscopy, are stored in the PDB 
file format (<i>Campbell et all,2016</i>) (Fig 2).

            Shown is the protein structure modell. Structure is hierarchically 
            ordered in Primary, Secoundary, Tertiary and Quarternary. 
            Informations about Structures experimentally identified are stored 
            in the central protein data bank. Icons are taken from Bioicons and 
            the PDB (<i>Duerr et all, 2024; Berman et all, 2003</i>).

### 1.2. The PDB-file-Format 

<p>
The PDB file format is a text file, which is used for representing the 3D 
Structure of Proteins in form of atomic coordinates and additional information’s 
of this proteins. In General the PDB file consists of series of text records and 
each contains different types of information about the structure. A text record 
describes one line in the file. 
This records are arranged in a specific defined order that
describes the structure of the protein. Files that are written in the format 
end with .pdb and get in the PDB often a unique identifier (<i>Berman et all.,
2000; RCSB PDB,2024</i>) (Fig.3).
</p>

            and the function of the three main parts. Parts of this figure are
            taken from Biocon (<i>Duerr et all.,2024)</i></a>.
        </font
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
On the top of the .PDB File is a more introductory part where record types are 
used that describe more general information’s about the protein and the 
researchers that identified the protein. 
Some Record types present in the title section are:
<ul>
    <li>HEADER: Brief description of the structure </li>
    <li>TITLE: Name of experiment or molecule represented in the entry </li>
    <li>SOURCE: Biological or chemical source of each molecule in the entry </li>
</ul>

The next part of the PDB format contains structural information about the 
structure:

    residues around sheets</li>
</ul>
<li> <b>Other sections:</b> </li>
<ul>
    <li>CISPEP: specify peptides found in cis conformation 
    </li>
    <li>SITE: describes residues comprising catalytic, co-factor, anti-codon and 
    other regulatory ligands  
    </li>
    <li>LINK: Describes the covalent linkage e.g. through a peptide bond, 
    between two residues </li> 
</ul>
<li><b>Coordinate Section</b>: </li>
<ul>
    <li> ATOM: represents for one atom the atomic coordinates for standard amino acids and 
    nucleotides as well as additional informations. </li>
    <li>HETATM: same as ATOM, but for non - polymer or other chemical 
    coordinates present in HET </li>
    <li>MODEL: specifies the model serial number, when multiple models of a
    structure are presented in one file. </li>
</ul>
<li><b>Connectivity and bookkeeping section</b>: </li>
<ul>
    <li>CONECT: describes which atoms are linked covalently and in which form </li>
    <li>MASTER: bookkeeping record or summary of file</li>
    <li> END: represents the File end of a PDB File</li>

### 1.3. PDB-file reader 

<p>
A PDB Parser is needed to parse information’s stored in the PDB file and process 
them further (Fig 1.). Functions of a PDB Reader are: 
<ul>
    <li> Read in of a PDB file</li> 
    <li> Parsing of data read by line: Identification of Record types and extract data </li>
    <li> Data structuring: store data in structured format and allow access to data </li>
    <li> Data processing and analysis: validate data, visualize, and analyse </li>
    <li> Error handling: handling of errors and missing data </li>
</ul>

# 2. Read PDB files with BioFSharp

### 2.1. PDB Parser file format:

The first step to understand the PDB parser format is the defination of the data 
types. Data types summarize the in the PDB File listed record types (Chp.1.2). We 
dont need for every record type a different data type, because this record types 
are linked together. The type Metadata contains several general information, and 
is seperately defined but connected to the type Structure . 
Structure contains several other informations stored in the hierarchy lower 
record types, which are atom,residue,chain and model (Fig.6). 

<figure>
    <img src="img/data_structure_diagram.png" alt="drawing" title="data structure" width="60%"/> 
    <figcaption>
        <font size="2">
            <b>Fig.6. Data structure to describe PDB Record types</b>: <br> 
            This figure represents the hierarchy of collections contained in a 
            PDB file. dashed Arrows represent the transitive relationsship while 
            normal arrows represent a direct link. Blue boxes represent the main 
            types relevant in a PDB File, while green boxes represent types 
            that carry important informations for the main types.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

### 2.2. Read the PDB file:

The first step for all levels is to read the PDB file as a sequence of lines
(readPDBFile).

readPBDFile ("data/rubisCOActivase.pdb")

<summary>

</summary>
*)

(*** hide ***)
readPBDFile "data/rubisCOActivase.pdb" |> Seq.toList
(***include-it:***)

(**
</details>

<p>
The readPDBFile function converts the linewise read in record type information’s 
into the in chapter 2.1 defined data model types. To understand the converting functions, it is important to keep 
in mind, that every item in the sequence is a line in the PDB file, that 
represents different type of information.
</p>
*)

(**
<br>

### 2.3. Read Metadata:

<p>
Now we can begin to convert the read in sequence of lines into the different 
datatypes shown in Fig.6. Metadata contains general information about the PDB 
file, such as the Header or the Author. The function readMetadata extracts 
information from the sequence of lines and returns a Metadata type. The Metadata 
type contains the following fields, representing the exactly equally named record
types in the PDB file:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Header: Unique PDB identifier </li>
<li>Title: Title for represented analysis</li>
<li>Compound: Macromolecular content of entry </li>
<li>Source: Biological or chemical source of each biological molecule in exp. </li>
<li>Keywords: Set of relevant categorizing terms</li>
<li>ExpData: Describes experiment in file </li>
<li>Authors: Authors of PDB file</li>
<li>Remarks: Additional experimental details, annotations, comments, and information</li>
<li>Caveats: Errors and unresolved issues in file </li>
</ul>
(<i>wwPDB,2021</i>)

    
<p>
The function readMetadata needs a sequence of lines as input, 
which you get through the in 2.2 described readPDBFile function and returns 
the Metadata type with the informations describing the Metadata.
</p>

### 2.4. Read Atomic information:

<p>
In addition to the metadata, we also want to extract structural information about 
the biomolecule structure. The Reading of the structural information is done using 
various levels. The levels are designed using the “bottom-up” approach, where we first 
read the atomic information, describing the details and generalize then gradually (Fig.7).
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="img/structure_level.png" alt="drawing" title="structure level" width="80%"/> 
        <figcaption>
            <font size="2">
                <b>Fig.7. Various levels of structure in the PDB Parser</b>: <br> 
                Shown is a schematic diagram that visualizes the various levels 
                to describe the protein structure. The last (top) level to describe 
                a protein is structure, that summarizes all levels before. Parts 
                of the diagram are taken from BioIcons  (<i>Duerr,2012</i>)
. 
            </font>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The most precise level to describe the 3D structure of a protein is the atomic level. 
The function readAtom uses again the sequence of lines as input and returns a 
list with Atom type items. In this case every Atom is described by the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
<li>SerialNumber: Unique serial number of atom in entry </li>
<li>AtomName: Name of atom in entry e.g. CA </li>
<li>AltLoc: Alternative location indicator </li>
<li>Coordinates: 3D Vector containing X,Y,Z,coordinates of atom in Angstrom </li>
<li>Occupancy: Probability of atom being present in this conformation in crystal 
structure </li>
<li>TempFactor: Temperature factor of atom in Angstrom </li>
<li>SegId: Optional segment identifier </li>
<li>Element: Element symbol of atom, e.g. C </li>
<li>Charge: Optional charge of atom,  </li>
<li>Hetatm: is Atom an Hetatm? </li>
</ul>
(<i>wwPDB,2021</i>)

<p>
The principle of the readAtom function is similar to the readMetadata function, 
where we read in the sequence of lines, filter for ATOM and HETATM items and then 
convert the item's informations to the corresponding Atom type fields (Fig.8).
</p>

types is taken from <i> UCSF Computer Graphics Laboratory </i>.
</font>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If you just need all Atom's without information's about the Residue, Chain or Model,
they belong to, you can use the readAtom function directly and get a list of all 
Atoms in the PDB file.

### 2.5. Read Residues:

<p>
As you can see in Fig.7, the next level to describe the structure of a protein 
is the residue level. A residue is in the case of proteins the Amino acid. The 
readResidues function groups Atoms by the correspondence to the Residue they belong 
to and returns a list of items of the Residue type. One Residue could be exactly 
identified by the name, the nr and the optional insertion code. The Residue type 
is described by the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ResidueName: Name of residue, e.g. ALA </li>
<li>ResidueNumber: Unique number Number of residue in chain </li>
<li>InsertionCode: Optional insertion code for residue </li>
<li>SecStructureType: Type of secondary structure the residue belongs to </li>
<li>Modification: Describes optional modifications of residue, e.g. Phosphorylation </li> 
<li>Atoms: List of Atoms, that belong to the residue </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you just need all Residues without information's about the Chain or Model,
they belong to, you can use the readResidue function directly and get a list of all 
Residues in the PDB file. The input of the readResidues function is again the sequence 
of lines, read in in readPDBFile.
</p>

<br>

### 2.6. Read Chains:

<p>
When you have a multimer e.g. haemoglobin as protein to analyse, you should 
analyse every chain separately. The readChain function handles 
with the next higher level to describe the structure of a protein, the chain level 
(Fig.7.). Chains consist of several residues. The readChain function groups the 
Residues you extracted in the previous step by  the chainID, which is the unique 
identifier of the chain in the PDB file.<br>
If you dont need to seperate by the correspondance to one model, 
you can use the readChain function directly and get a list of all Chains in the 
PDB file.

### 2.7. Read Models:

<p>
Often PDB files describe more than one model of a protein. A model is a specific 
conformation (spatial arrangement) of the protein, determined by experimental 
methods (e.g. X-ray crystallography, NMR). For example a protein conformation could 
be described in the native and in the unfolded state. The Model data type, which 
is the result of the readModel function, contains beside of the Chains part of 
the Model in addtion the  Linkage field, describing in which form the Atoms of 
the Model are linked together and the Site field, which describes which Sites 
exist, e.g. Active centre. Linkages and Sites are additional Readers, you could
also use seperate. All three read functions, use again the sequence of lines 
(readPDBFile) as inputand return a Linkage,Site or Model type. The functions looks
like follwing

<br>

### 2.8. Read the complete structure:

The last level to describe the structures in the PDB file is a summary of the entire 
information's (All Models) in the PDB file and the Metadata. The two field of the 
structure type are Models and Metadata, which are lists of the Model type and 
the Metadata type. As input you just need the filepath of the PDB file you want 
to analyse and the function returns a Structure type, containing all information's 
you read in in the previous steps.

# 3. Application of the PDB Parser: 

<p>
One example of the application of the PDB Parser is the first step in protein structure
modeling, the pre modeling step. In this step you extract per model the coordinates 
of all Atoms and one information for the color code e.g.,correspondance to which 
Residuename it belongs and create a 3D scatterplot.
</p>
